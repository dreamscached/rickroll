# RickrollCXX

A C++ program that as the title suggests, rickrolls the user. What did you
expect? That's all it does. Deal with it.

[Original project][1] created by TheSystemGuy1337, further on maintained 
and worked on by dreamscached.

## Building

RickrollCXX uses CMake for building. You'll need MinGW/Visual Studio 
compiler on Windows and GCC on Unix/Darwin.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dreamscached/rickrollcxx
mkdir rickrollcxx/build && cd rickrollcxx/build
cmake .. && make
```
